"""canonical()/slugify() parity against podcast-digest's originals.

Three applications (podcast-digest, clippings-topics, intake-digest) now write
`99 topics/` and agree on identity only by applying the same two functions to
a name — they do not talk to each other (see intake_digest/sanitize.py's
header). This file pins the exact outputs of `podcast_agent.entities.canonical`
and `podcast_agent.sanitize.slugify` at the commit this was ported from
(fac8a1f), captured by actually running them, not by re-deriving the rule —
so a future edit to *this* copy that quietly diverges fails here, without this
repo needing to import podcast-digest as a dependency.
