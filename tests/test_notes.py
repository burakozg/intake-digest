"""The tests that matter: another writer's content survives our run.

Ported from clippings-topics' tests/test_notes.py — same merge logic, this
app's OWNER/KEY_PREFIX. A merge bug here does not raise — it silently eats a
section of somebody's vault, and the damage looks like Obsidian losing notes
rather than a bug in this program.

Fixture shaped like a real note (``99 topics/anthropic.md``): human prose at
the top, then podcast-digest's owned region, with frontmatter carrying both
unprefixed keys and another writer's prefixed ones.
