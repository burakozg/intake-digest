"""The `pending_asr` drain job (design §5 S2).

Scheduled every `transcription.asr_poll_interval_minutes` (default 5).
Probes the worker once; if it answers, works the queue oldest-first until a
retry fails, at which point it stops rather than hammering a worker that has
just gone back to sleep mid-drain. `max_concurrent_asr` is enforced by
running strictly sequentially — the worker itself is the sole contended
resource (design §5 S2), not this process.
