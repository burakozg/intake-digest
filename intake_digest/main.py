"""Application assembly and entrypoint.

Wires configuration, SQLite state and the API together. Invalid configuration
crashes here with a readable message rather than starting half-configured
(config.py's extra="forbid" + validators do the crashing; this module is where
it happens at process start).

No runtime self-update for yt-dlp (design §9 proposes a weekly check): the
container's rootfs is read-only (docker-compose.nas.yml), which rules it out
by construction. The version is pinned in the image and rebuilt instead — see
Dockerfile — and surfaced at /healthz so staleness is at least visible.
