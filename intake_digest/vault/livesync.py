"""The vault's CouchDB, in Self-hosted LiveSync's document format.

**Ported from `clippings_topics/vault.py`** (`LiveSyncVault`), itself ported
from `podcast_agent/vault.py` — the canonical implementation, with
`taster/backend/app/couchdb_client.py` as the first. The format is not
documented by the plugin: it was reverse-engineered from what a live v0.25
client writes, and is now in production in four projects. Fix bugs in all of
them or none.

Two documents per file: a **chunk**, content-addressed so identical text is
stored once, and an **entry**, keyed by the *lowercased* vault path, listing
its chunks. `list_prefix` — clippings-topics' addition over the original —
is what lets M6's inbox watcher and later a duplicate-note check discover
what is already in a folder rather than being told.

Two plugin settings must stay off, and both break this silently: `encrypt`
(E2EE) and `usePathObfuscation`. This writes plaintext chunks keyed by path.

Uses `intake_digest.config.VaultConfig` directly rather than redeclaring a
narrower dataclass — the four attributes this reads (`couchdb_url`, `db`,
`user`, `timeout_s`) already exist there, alongside the vault-folder settings
nothing else here needs.
