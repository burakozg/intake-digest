"""One topic note, many writers.

**Ported from `podcast_agent/notes.py`** by way of `clippings_topics/notes.py`
(the third copy, and this the fourth) — only `OWNER` and `KEY_PREFIX` differ,
plus the absence of podcast-digest's legacy-adoption machinery: like
clippings-topics, this app has never written a topic note in any other
format, so there is nothing here to adopt. Fix bugs in every copy or none —
a divergence here corrupts notes the other three applications also write to.

Whole-file notes (`13 video-summaries/`, `14 video-transcripts/`) do not use
this module at all — plan §1.2 keeps section ownership to `99 topics/`, the
one folder genuinely shared with other writers. See vault/livesync.py's
`project(..., merge=False)` for the whole-file path.

A region between ``<!-- begin:<owner> -->`` and ``<!-- end:<owner> -->`` is
owned wholly by that writer, replaced on every run. Frontmatter keys are
namespaced per owner (prefixed keys are ours, replaced every run; unprefixed
keys like `title`/`tags` describe the note as a whole and are create-only —
supplied only when absent, never overwritten).
